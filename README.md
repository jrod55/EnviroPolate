## EnviroPolate

This repo contains a series of scripts for interpolating data from a sparse grid onto a dense grid. Included are scripts for fitting several different GAM 2d-spline models, and performing cross-validation to choose the best model. An example is provided using the environmental variable PPFD, collected at one time point in the PhenoArcch phenotyping platform. The sparse grid consists of data collected from 10 sensors distributed in the platform, and the dense grid is a physical metric coordinate system to interpolate PPFD down to the individual pot-level.
